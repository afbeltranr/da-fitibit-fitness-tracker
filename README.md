[![Continuous Delivery](https://github.com/afbeltranr/ml-fitibit-fitness-tracker/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/afbeltranr/ml-fitibit-fitness-tracker/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

## Project Description

This project is focused on exploring and analyzing the Fitbit fitness dataset. The primary goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights and patterns within the data. The project leverages Docker for containerization and continuous integration (CI) to ensure a smooth and automated workflow.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the Fitbit dataset to uncover insights and patterns.
- **Docker and Containers**: Use Docker to containerize the application, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Implement CI using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment.
- **Machine Learning with Time Series**: Future work will focus on using time series machine learning to associate consumer behavior with overall health.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Docker
- Kaggle API credentials
