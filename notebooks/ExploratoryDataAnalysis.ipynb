    "This notebook aims to explore and analyze the Fitbit dataset. The dataset contains various CSV files with information on daily activities, calories burned, heart rate, sleep patterns, and more. We will start by listing the directory structure of the dataset, then proceed to load and inspect some key CSV files. Basic statistics and visualizations will be generated to understand the data better.\n",
